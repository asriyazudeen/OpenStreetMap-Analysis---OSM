# OpenStreetMap-Analysis---OSM
Cleaning OpenStreetMap Data with Python

<h2>Project Overview</h2>

<p>The aim of the project is to choose any area of the world in https://www.openstreetmap.org and use data munging techniques, such as assessing the quality of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity, to clean the OpenStreetMap data for a part of the world that you care about. Finally, you will choose either MongoDB or SQL as the data schema to complete your project.</p>
